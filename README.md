Cloud-based Housing Rental Website

This cloud-based housing rental website provides an intuitive and user-friendly platform for property owners to list their rentals and for users to browse and find suitable housing options. Through cloud technologies, the website streamlines the property upload process and presents property listings in a formatted and easily accessible manner, improving the overall rental experience. It aims to develop a streamlined housing rental website with two main functions: property upload and browsing. Users can easily upload their properties by filling out a provided format, including property details, rental price, amenities, and an accompanying photograph. The website fetches and displays property listings from a cloud database, presenting them as formatted objects for a simplified view of available housing options.

The browse page serves as a central hub for users to explore all property listings. By leveraging cloud technologies, the website fetches property details from the database, providing a streamlined and user-friendly browsing experience.

For property upload, users can conveniently add their own properties to the browse portal. They fill out the required details, such as property name, location, daily rent, and select checkboxes for amenities. The website's integration with Google Firebase automatically populates the email address and mobile number fields, ensuring a convenient user experience.
